# Applied-Machine-Learning
-This repository shows the projects that I worked on in my Applied Machine Learning Course<br>
-This class was heavily reliant on Python, so we dug deeped into Python scripting<br>
-We used a wide variety of Machine Learning techniques to create many different real world applications
